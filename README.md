# SMS-Logger
This is a Python code for interfacing a Sim800 Module with a PC using USB to UART. The data would be saved in a excel/csv file and can be exported in PDF format.
Make sure you have an FTDI device attached to a GSM module.

TODO:
1) The code needs a bit of cleanup.
2) Addition of a picture to show the connections of hardware.
3) Increase sample output files.
